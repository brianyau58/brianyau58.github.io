    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>I am always interested in multimedia, something like graphic design or animation. As I think they are a
      great medium to express someone's thoughts. I can combine different elements of media like color, image, video,
      sound to deliver messages, but not just use words. It is way more interesting and able to give a strong impression
      to the target audience if we use these different elements wisely.
      <br>
      <br>
      In this Portfolio, some of my works will be displayed. They included logo re-design, some poster ideas, and
      videos. There are all from different aspects of media and I would like to continue to explore more about the
      elements of media.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Pacific coffee</h3>
    <p id=p4>You can told that the style of the cartoon in the logo are kind of old school. As Pacific Coffee is a brand
      from the 90s in America, I want to recreate a retro cartoon style which fit the brand.

    <p id=p4>The original one is a mermaid with a crown in a realistic style. My idea is turn it into a cute version,
      this can be making into different merchandise and may attract more customer to buy due to the cartoon style.

    <p id=p4>To fit the brand's name, simply two gentlemen brewing coffee are already suitable and able to emphasize the
      brand name where customers are able to recognize the brand while the logo comes insight.

              <h3 style="color: black;">Front</h3>
              <p>I have joined a Halloween Night event in PolyU. The background of this event is a hacker with a
                mystery power dragged all the students who have received this invitation card earlier into a different
                word.
                That is why the invitation card have the glitch effect to fit the theme of the event.</p>

              <p>This logo is tranformed from the logo of the PolyU.As you can see, it is changed into two letter “HW”,

                Overall, I want to bring out the message of privacy is an important topic to discuss nowadays.</p>

              <p>This is a poster I made when I was learning the color function of Photoshop.</p><br>

              <p>This photo was taken in Japan when I had a trip back then. When I am exploring the color
                function in photoshop, I came up with an idea that uses a different color to represent the building
                process. As you can see the left-most part of the building are almost complete while the middle and the
                right-most part are still in progress.</p>

      <h2 style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Collective Memory of Hong Kong</h2><br>
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">The idea of the video is to show different collective memory of 
        Hong Kong people. There were many places that were used to be
         iconic or meaningful for Hong Kong people. However, some of them
         are removed or replaced because of the development of the city. 
        It will be great if I combine some of them together into a video to 
        reminisce about these places.</p>
