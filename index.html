    <h3 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h3>
    <p id=p1>I am always interested in multimedia, something like graphic design or animation. As I think they are a great medium to express someone's thoughts. I can combine different elements of media like color, image, video, sound to deliver messages, but not just use words. It is way more interesting and able to give a strong impression to the target audience if we use these different elements wisely.
			In this Portfolio, some of my works will be displayed. They included logo re-design, some poster ideas, and videos. There are all from different aspects of media and I would like to continue to explore more about the elements of media.

    <div>
      <p id="p2">It should be very iconic and reminiscent of the brand. And a cartoon character can do the job well for making a lasting impression to people which able to make people recognize the brand at a glance. So, I was thinking maybe cartoon character is a decent option to be the representative of a brand. The following desgin ideas are change the original logo of some brands into cartoon charatcer.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Pacific coffee</h3>
    <p id=p4>You can told that the style of the cartoon in the logo are kind of old school. As Pacific Coffee is a brand from the 90s in America, I want to recreate a retro cartoon style which fit the brand.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Starbucks</h3>
    <p id=p4>The original one is a mermaid with a crown in a realistic style. My idea is turn it into a cute version, this can be making into different merchandise and may attract more customer to buy due to the cartoon style.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Brew Bros</h3>
    <p id=p4>To fit the brand's name, simply two gentlemen brewing coffee are already suitable and able to emphasize the brand name where customers are able to recognize the brand while the logo comes insight.
