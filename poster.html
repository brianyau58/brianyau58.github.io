        <h1>Poster 1</h1>
        <p id="p1">I have joined a Halloween Night event in PolyU. The background of this event is a hacker with a
          mystery power dragged all the students who have received this invitation card earlier into a different
          word.
          That is why the invitation card have the glitch effect to fit the theme of the event.
          <br><br>
          This logo is tranformed from the logo of the PolyU.As you can see, it is changed into two letter
          “HW”,
          which represent the short form of “Halloween”.</p>

        <h1>Poster 2</h1>
        <p id="p1">I came up with an idea where the QR code is mixed some eyes which indicate there will be someone
          watching us when we scan the QR code.<br><br>
          Overall, I want to bring out the message of privacy is an important topic to discuss nowadays.</p><br>

        <h1>Poster 3</h1>
        <p id="p1">This is a poster I made when I was learning the color function of Photoshop.
          <br><br>
          This photo was taken in Japan when I had a trip back then. When I am exploring the color
          function in photoshop, I came up with an idea that uses a different color to represent the building
          process. As you can see the left-most part of the building are almost complete while the middle and the
          right-most part are still in progress.</p>
